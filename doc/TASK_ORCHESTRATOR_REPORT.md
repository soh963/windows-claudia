# Task Orchestrator Supervisor Report - Claudia Project Analysis

## Executive Summary

As the Task Orchestrator Supervisor, I've conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Claudia project and identified critical issues that need immediate attention. This report provides a detailed task distribution plan for all agents to achieve a zero-bug build.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. âœ… AI Model Combo Box Dropdown Visibility Issue (FIXED)

**Problem**: The model selector dropdown was getting cut off at the bottom of the screen.

**Root Cause**: The custom Popover component lacked viewport boundary detection and automatic repositioning logic.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added viewport boundary detection in Popover component
- Implemented automatic repositioning logic (auto flip from bottom to top when needed)
- Added maxHeight with scroll for large content
- Fixed positioning to use `fixed` instead of `absolute` for proper viewport calculations

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/ui/popover.tsx` - Added viewport detection, auto-positioning, and maxHeight support
- `/src/components/ModelSelector.tsx` - Updated to use improved Popover with auto positioning

### 2. ðŸ”§ Chat Session Error: "No conversation found with session ID"

**Problem**: Users seeing error when trying to access chat sessions.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Session JSONL files are not being found at expected paths
2. The error occurs in `load_session_history` function in `claude.rs`
3. Session file path structure: `~/.claude/projects/{project_id}/{session_id}.jsonl`

**Potential Issues**:
- Project ID mismatch between frontend and backend
- Session files being created in wrong directory
- Race condition where session is accessed before file is created
- File permissions issues on Windows

**Recommended Solution**:
1. Add better error logging to identify exact file paths being checked
2. Implement session file existence verification before loading
3. Add retry mechanism with exponential backoff
4. Create session recovery mechanism

### 3. ðŸ“‹ Missing Features Analysis (Based on PRD Review)
