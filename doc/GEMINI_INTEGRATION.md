## 1. Gemini API Research (2025)

This research provides a guide to the latest Gemini API patterns and best practices for achieving universal model compatibility.

### Key Findings
- **Model Naming Conventions**: Use full model names (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`). Three-digit suffixes (e.g., `-001`) indicate preview versions. `gemini-pro` is deprecated and will cause 404 errors.
- **Model Availability**: `gemini-1.5-pro` and `gemini-1.5-flash` are not available for new projects after April 29, 2025.
- **Authentication**: Use the `x-goog-api-key` header for API key authentication. For enterprise use, service account authentication with ephemeral tokens is recommended.
- **Rate Limiting**: The free tier is limited to 5 requests per minute (RPM) and is suitable for development only. Production applications should upgrade to a paid tier.
- **Cost Optimization**: Use batch mode for a 50% cost reduction on non-real-time requests and implement caching for repeated contexts.

## 2. Session Isolation Fixes

This section details the implementation of a robust session isolation system to prevent cross-contamination and ensure data integrity.

### Issues Fixed
- **Weak Session ID Generation**: Replaced simple timestamp-based IDs with a secure method using **UUID v4 + timestamp + salt** for maximum uniqueness.
- **No Session Registry**: Implemented a `GeminiSessionRegistry` to track the lifecycle of active sessions.
- **Missing Deduplication**: Added content-based deduplication to prevent processing duplicate messages.
- **Generic Event Broadcasting**: Shifted to session-specific events only to ensure proper isolation.
- **Poor Session Isolation**: Integrated with existing isolation managers to create and validate memory boundaries for each session.
- **Model Endpoint Issues**: Updated model mappings to support the latest 2025 models and improve error handling.

### Architecture Improvements
- **Enhanced Session Lifecycle**: A full lifecycle management system including registration, isolation, deduplication, validation, and cleanup.
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Automatic cleanup of old message IDs to prevent memory leaks in long-running sessions.

## 3. Universal Model Compatibility

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the plan to ensure 100% compatibility with all Gemini models.

### Solution Architecture
- **Dynamic Model Discovery**: A system to automatically discover and validate available models from the Gemini API, with caching and periodic refreshing.
- **Intelligent Fallback Chain**: A strategy for automatically falling back to a similar or alternative model if the primary choice fails. Strategies can be based on similarity, performance, cost, or latest availability.
- **Model Capability Matrix**: A comprehensive database of model capabilities, including context window size, supported languages, and special features.

### Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1: Research & Discovery**: Deep dive into the Gemini API and conduct compatibility testing.
- **Phase 2: Core Infrastructure**: Build a dynamic model registry and a request adapter to handle model-specific requirements.
- **Phase 3: Error Handling & Recovery**: Implement a comprehensive error handler with retry mechanisms and exponential backoff.
- **Phase 4: Testing & Validation**: Create an automated test suite to validate model compatibility and performance.
- **Phase 5: Integration & Deployment**: Integrate the universal client into the frontend and deploy the system.

### Success Metrics
- **Model Success Rate**: >99.9% (at least one model responds successfully).
- **Primary Model Success**: >95% (the user's selected model works).
- **Fallback Activation Rate**: <5%.
- **Average Response Time**: <2s for the 95th percentile.
